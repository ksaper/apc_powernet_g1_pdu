### APC PowerNet Shell for Quali CloudShell
This is a Gen1 Shell based on the Avocent PDU Shell (https://github.com/QualiSystemsLab/Avocent-PM-PDU-Shell)

The MIB table is for the APC PowerNet (PowerNet-MIB), and has been tested against and updated Schnider Electric APC PDU.

The shell follows as closely as possible the PDU Shell Standard 
    (https://github.com/QualiSystems/cloudshell-standards/blob/master/Documentation/pdu_standard.md)
The current standard doesn't support Location and Serial Number, but the lookups in the Autoload are there, just currently commented out.

There is also a supporting Gen2 version of this shell.
